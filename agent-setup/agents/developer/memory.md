## 2026-04-18 — init

- **Did**: Initialised agent definition and empty memory.
- **Why**: Project bootstrap.
- **Learned**: Stack detected as node. Architecture: monorepo (source: vision §2).
- **Open**: See `.project/state.json > clarifications_pending`.

## 2026-04-18 — publish bootstrap commits

- **Did**: Split the repository bootstrap into multiple Conventional Commits, verified lint/test/build, and prepared the branch for push to GitHub.
- **Why**: Keep the initial monorepo history reviewable and aligned with the project publish rules.
- **Learned**: The workspace passes `pnpm lint`, `pnpm test`, and `pnpm build`, but the configured pre-commit gate is not yet backed by a `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file.
- **Open**: Decide whether the repository should add a real pre-commit configuration or remove that gate from the documented publish workflow.
